# CString
My implementation of a C style string type.

The thought of this code would be for it to be used in an embedded low level environment. C does not allow for declaration of char arrays (known as strings) of an unknown size. This will allocate memory at a rate of 32 bits or more.

# Functions
_concat()
_compare()
_toInt()
_toDouble()
